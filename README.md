# Shopping Cart Website ðŸ›’

A modern shopping cart website built with Vite and React, featuring a cart management system that uses localStorage to persist user-selected items. The website provides a seamless and responsive user experience for adding, updating, and removing products from the cart, ensuring data remains available even after a page refresh.

## Key Features
- **Add to Cart**: Easily add products to the shopping cart with a single click.
- **Update Cart**: Adjust the quantity of items directly in the cart.
- **Remove from Cart**: Effortlessly remove items from the cart when no longer needed.
- **LocalStorage Integration**: Cart data is stored in localStorage, so items stay saved between page reloads.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive UI for a consistent experience on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Built with Vite and React**: Leveraging Vite's fast development environment and React's component-based architecture for a smooth development workflow.

## Technologies Used
- **Vite**: For fast development and optimized build process.
- **React**: Component-based architecture for building user interfaces.
- **localStorage**: Used for persisting cart data.
- **CSS Modules/Tailwind CSS** (optional): For styling the components.
